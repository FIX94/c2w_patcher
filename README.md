# c2w_patcher
This patcher will allow you to patch a OSv1 cafe2wii image to unlock the wii PPC clock multiplier to its wiiu speed, giving you 1.215ghz in wii mode.  
Grab the current version from the Releases tab, edit the starbuck_key.txt to contain the wiiu starbuck ancast key and put it into a folder with c2w.img.  
After that just run it, if all went well it should put out a c2p.img, you can use that file as a new c2w.img in for example wii vc together with sign_c2w_patcher.
